# graphql-sequelize
GraphQL queries with Sequelize.

This is mostly a toy trying to implement the ideas of GraphQL with Sequelize.
No attempts will be made to support writes, and no promises that this will follow the eventual spec when it's released (although we'll obviously try to catch up with the spec when the time comes, if this library doesn't get superseeded with something else).

Should be used with [ssacl](https://github.com/pumpupapp/ssacl) for just a minimal layer of safety.
